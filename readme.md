My Printing Code Class Final incorporating [Rune JS](http://runemadsen.github.io/rune.js/).

I used the codebase from my [Designing For Data Personalization Final "Today I Learned"](https://github.com/SongHia/today-i-learned).

This is messy and needs some updates to be able to toggle between the 3 different layouts.

These computationally generated SVG designs were printed on an Epson wide-format (17 inch) Archival Art Printer.
